# [Advent of Code 2019](https://adventofcode.com/2019)

We want to learn Functional Programming, for this we try to solve challenges of the Advent of Code 2019 in that way.

## Participe

Create a PR with your player file inside each challenge, FE: `./1/player.john.js`.

Inside the js file place the part you're doing of the challenge and the function.

```javascript
const part1 = input => {
  /* Day X - Part 1 statements here */
};
const part2 = input => {
  /* Day X - Part 2 statements here */
};

module.exports = { part1, part2 };
```

The input is generated in the `data.js`, check it to ensure you parse the correct data-type.

Execute the challenge with the day number and compare the results.

```sh
node index.js 'challengeDayNumber'
```

## Help

If you want to help, create a PR with improved versions of our codes, we want to learn! :)
